# Social Media Analytics Using COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview

This project presents a big data-driven framework for the large-scale analysis of over one million COVID-19-related tweets (pp. 1, 13). It utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) to transform semi-structured social media data into actionable insights for public health monitoring and policy formulation (pp. 1, 3).
🛠️ Core Analytical Pipeline
The framework integrates four major unsupervised and zero-shot analytical axes (p. 11):
Granular Topic Modeling: Uses HDBSCAN clustering on high-dimensional transformer embeddings (via all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and the BERTopic framework to identify nuanced subtopics (pp. 11, 16).
Dual-Layer Affective Estimation: Employs pre-trained transformer models to automate sentiment polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and granular emotion classification (e.g., joy, anger, fear) without manual labeling (pp. 12, 16).
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Implements the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect statistically deviant content, flagging potential misinformation, spam, or rare high-impact events (pp. 12, 18).
Bot Identification: Leverages the Botometer model to assign "Bot Scores" to accounts, enabling the filtration of synthetic amplification to ensure findings reflect genuine human discourse (pp. 12, 20).
📊 Dataset Overview
The analysis is conducted on a global corpus of English-language tweets collected across three critical pandemic phases between April 2020 and June 2021 (pp. 12-13):
Phase 1 (Early Response): ~235k tweets (April–June 2020) (p. 13).
Phase 2 (Peak Fatality): ~320k tweets (August–October 2020) (p. 13).
Phase 3 (Vaccine Deployment): ~489k tweets (April–June 2021) (p. 13).

## Dataset

The project uses a COVID-19 related social media dataset. The dataset must be downloaded and prepared before running the analytics pipeline.

To download and set up the dataset, run:

```bash
bash dataset.sh

```
---
## Environment Setup

The project uses a Conda environment defined in covid.yml.

Create and activate the environment

```bash
conda env create -f covid.yml
conda activate COVID

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## Usage

After setting up the environment and downloading the dataset, run the analytics pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

or the updated script

```bash
python new_main.py
```

## Project Workflow

Data Acquisition : The dataset is downloaded and prepared using dataset.sh.

Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned, structured, and validated for analysis.

Analytics and Transformation: The pipeline performs analytical transformations to identify patterns and trends within the dataset.

Output Generation: Processed results, visualizations, and summaries are saved to the outputs/ directory.

Reporting: Findings and methodology are documented in Cloud_and_big_data_report.pdf.

---
## Outputs

The outputs/ directory contains results generated by the pipeline, which may include:

Aggregated data files
Visualizations and plots
Summary statistics and analytical reports

These outputs help illustrate insights derived from COVID-19 related social media activity.
