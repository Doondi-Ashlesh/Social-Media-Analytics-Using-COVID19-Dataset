# Social Media Analytics Using COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview

This repository implements a **social media analytics pipeline** that processes and analyzes a COVID-19–related dataset to extract meaningful insights. The project focuses on data ingestion, preprocessing, analytics, and output generation, with an emphasis on reproducibility and automation.

The pipeline is suitable for academic, research, and learning purposes related to data analytics, cloud computing, and big data workflows.

---
## Environment Setup

The project uses a Conda environment defined in covid.yml.

Create and activate the environment

```bash
conda env create -f covid.yml
conda activate COVID

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## Usage

After setting up the environment and downloading the dataset, run the analytics pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

or the updated script

```bash
python new_main.py
```

## Project Workflow

Data Acquisition : The dataset is downloaded and prepared using dataset.sh.

Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned, structured, and validated for analysis.

Analytics and Transformation: The pipeline performs analytical transformations to identify patterns and trends within the dataset.

Output Generation: Processed results, visualizations, and summaries are saved to the outputs/ directory.

Reporting: Findings and methodology are documented in Cloud_and_big_data_report.pdf.

---
## Outputs

The outputs/ directory contains results generated by the pipeline, which may include:

Aggregated data files
Visualizations and plots
Summary statistics and analytical reports

These outputs help illustrate insights derived from COVID-19 related social media activity.
